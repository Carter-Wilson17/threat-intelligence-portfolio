Threat Intelligence Reports and Projects 

Hi! I'm Carter Wilson, a Cybersecurity student specializing in Threat Intelligence. This repository holds my research and threat reports on current attack trends and AI-based attacks in the world of cybersecurity. This repository was created to showcase my work, but also to provide insight into potential mitigation strategies for newer attack trends. Please feel free to reach out if you wish to discuss these reports further!
